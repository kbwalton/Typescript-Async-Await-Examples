# Overview
This project demonstrates key features of the TypeScript programming language by implementing a variety of small programs and concepts. The goal is to deepen my understanding of TypeScript's syntax, object-oriented structure, asynchronous capabilities, and error handling, all while practicing how to build and run TypeScript applications in a Node.js environment.

The software includes examples of:

- Displaying output to the terminal

- Using recursion to solve problems

- Creating and working with classes

- Working with lists and arrays

- Handling asynchronous API requests with async/await

- Throwing and catching exceptions

By exploring these features, I aimed to become more confident in writing and organizing TypeScript code and understanding how it compiles and runs in a Node.js context.

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code – Source code editor

- Node.js – Runtime environment for executing JavaScript and TypeScript

- TypeScript – Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing

- ts-node – Runs TypeScript files directly without compiling to JavaScript

- npm – Package manager for installing dependencies

# Useful Websites

- [TypeScript Official Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [JSONPlaceholder API] – Used for async/await fetch example (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
- [MDN Web Docs - Async/Await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS/Promises)
- [Stack Overflow] - For solving TypeScript and Node.js errors(https://stackoverflow.com/questions)

# Future Work

- Add unit tests using Jest to validate each function

- Incorporate user input via command-line arguments

- Refactor code into separate modules with better organization

- Add ESLint or TSLint for code quality and consistency

- Use environment variables to configure API endpoints securely
